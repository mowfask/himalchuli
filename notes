Timing
======
-> Do everything in regular intervals
    -> Read panel input
    -> Read sensor input (motor rotation counter, motor current and feeder)
    -> Set motor and panel output accordingly
-> ADC conversion
    -> ~150kHz ADC clock
    -> First conversion after switch on takes 25 ADC cycles (167µs),
        successive ones take 13 ADC cyles (87µs)
-> Button switch inputs
    -> motor rotation counter should work up to 10Hz -> 100ms cycle
    -> input panel switches should not take longer than 20ms to be registered
    => 20ms for contact debouncing => 5-10ms timing interval would be okay
=> Totally feasible to run every 5-10ms, start the ADC, wait for it (167µs)
    and do everything else afterwards.
    -> 1Mhz clock -> 5000 to 10000 cycles using an 8-bit counter -> prescaler
        of 32
    => 256*32 = 8192 cycles -> 8.192ms interval

Input filter (only on sensors, not on panel input)
==================================================
RC filter + Pullup
    -> R = 1k; C = 1µ -> cutoff frequency 1kHz

Feeder detection
